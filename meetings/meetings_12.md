## Bullying
We've been having a discussion on the issues list re [bullying](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/issues/68). Let's open the discussion to see what can be done to help.

## Outcomes and Updates
See [README.md](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/) 

### [Chair Train] Chair Guidance and Sessions
Our discussions lead us to detail the Buddy System. We aim to pass this to the team to manage. Are we happy with this, or do we want to do more?

#### Buddy Process
Describing a system on [Buddy System](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/buddy_system.md). 

#### Chair Emails
Reminder that our [chair email templates](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/chair_emails.md) exist. Can / should we do more?

### [Guide] Updated /guide (Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees)
Guide is being structured over in [/Guide on Github](https://github.com/w3c/Guide). Need to work on Information Architecture.

Have we had further thoughts on consistency of Working Group homepages?

### [Testing] Testing
We will detail some items on testing in Guide/Github (do we know who would be best to write this?!). Testing issue has been added to [W3C Process Github Repo](https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/157). 

### [CSI] Common Standards Issues Document and Triage Process
Final touches, then can present at TPAC.

### [Ombudsman] Ombudsman for Working Group Effectiveness with Guidelines for Escalation
Do we want to write a process for this?
