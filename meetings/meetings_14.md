Our discussions lead us to detail the Buddy System. We aim to pass this to the team to manage. Are we happy with this, or do we want to do more?

#### Chair Emails
Reminder that our [chair email templates](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/chair_emails.md) exist. Can / should we do more?

Guide is being structured over in [/Guide on Github](https://github.com/w3c/Guide).

Our [Issues]() detail some things which we think should be included in /guide. Some will require us to write some things, such as [an explainer template](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/issues/66). 

### [Testing] Testing
We will detail some items on testing in Guide/Github (do we know who would be best to write this?!). Testing issue has been added to [W3C Process Github Repo](https://github.com/w3c/w3process/issues/157). 

### [Ombudsman] Ombudsman for Working Group Effectiveness with Guidelines for Escalation
