# Chair Questions

At this year's TPAC the members of the Working Group Effectiveness Task Force will canvas working group chairs to discover some of their tips, issues, success stories and needs related to group effectiveness. Not all these questions need to be asked of all chairs, but please try to ask as many as you can, gather your feedback, and report on the call after TPAC.
