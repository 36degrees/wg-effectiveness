# Understanding the W3C Process
This document breaks down the 2018 W3C Process. This text can be included in the [Guide and Github] deliverable of this task force.

# Terms
* __W3C Recommendation__: W3C standards are referred to as "W3C Recommendations".
* __Technical Reports__:


# Standard Process Overview

## Setting Up Interest and Working Groups
* __Generating Interest__: a topic gains some interest within W3C. This could be via a [member submission](#), a [W3C run workshop](#), W3C team research, a [Community Group](#) or through the [WCIG](#).
* __AC Announcement__: the Director announces the development of an Interest or Working Group charter.
* __Charter Development__: the Interest / Working Group proponents work on the new group charter with a W3C team member.
* __Member Review__: W3C members review the charter, and give feedback.
* __Director Approval__: the Director approves the creation of the Interest / Working Group.

Each Working Group and Interest Group will be supported by at least one [W3C team member](#). Group participants are usually [Member Represenatives](#) although [Invited Experts](#) may also be able to join groups.

For more information, please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#introduction).

# Understanding W3C Participants
W3C has a number of participants. Below is a list of these and their roles.

## Members

W3C Members make up the bulk of participants in W3C Interest and Working Groups. Each member also has one seat on the [Advisory Committee](#). 

As well as particpating in Interest and Working Groups, members have access to Member-Only information, they can take advantage of the [Member Submission](#) process, and are invited to all [W3C Workshops and Symposia](#).

Please see [How to Join W3C](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/join) for guidelines on how to become a member of W3C.

For more information on members, please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Members).

Members which are related by business contracts such as subsidiaries, partnerships and contracting obligations should consult the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#MemberRelated) for instructions on declaring these relationships.

## Membership Consortia
A "Member Consortium" means a consortium, user society, or association of two or more individuals, companies, organizations or governments, or any combination of these entities which has the purpose of participating in W3C. Membership Consortia paid staff have the same rights and privileges of W3C Membership.

Those who require more information on Membership Consortia should refer to the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#MemberConsortia).

# Leadership and Leadership Groups
The W3C Leadership and Leadership Groups are responsible for the process, technical direction, group development and major decisions taken within the W3C.

## The Director
The Director is the lead technical architect at W3C. They have a number of responsibilties which are detailed in the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/). Some of these responsibilities are:

* chartering new Interest and Working Groups
* appointing group Chairs
* publication of technical reports
* deciding on outcomes for formal objections
* chairing the [TAG](#).

## Advisory Committee (AC)
Each W3C member organisation can nominate one person to the W3C Advisory Committee (AC). This Advisory Committee member will be added to both AC Mailing Lists (XXXXX for general annoucements and XXXXX for AC discussions) and are invited to AC meetings. The AC's responsibilities include:

* Reviewing group charter proposals, proposed recommendations and proposed process documents
* Electing [Advisory Board](#) members
* Electing [Technical Architecture Group](#) members
* Reviewing plans for W3C
* (Advisory Committee representatives may initiate an Advisory Committee Appeal).

The AC holds two face-to-face meetings a year: during TPAC (sometime during Sept, Oct or Nov) and a dedicated AC Meeting (usually Mar, Apr, May or June). At AC Meetings the AC will receive updates on the W3C Membership and finances, budget allocation, updates on Interest and Working Groups, and liaisons with other organisations. AC Meetings are annouced [here](https://www.w3.org/Member/Meeting/).

Advisory Committee should consult the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#coi) for instructions on disclosing relevant information.

For more information on AC membership and responsibilities, please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#ac).

## The W3C Team
The Team consists of the Director, CEO, W3C paid staff, unpaid interns, and [W3C Fellows](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Recruitment/Fellows) (Member employees working as part of the Team).  

The team provides technical leadership, supports Interest and Working Group acitivies, and manages communications to members and the public. The team may make [Team Submissions](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#TeamSubmission).

For more information on the W3C team see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Team).

## Advisory Board (AB)
The Advisory Board (AB) provides ongoing guidance to the Team on issues of strategy, management, legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. The AB also manages the evolution of the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/).

The AB is devised of nine individuals elected by the [AC](), and one team-elected chair (currently the W3C CEO). AB members participate as individuals, not on behalf of their employer. The AB provides updates on AB activities on the [AB website](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) and at AC Meetings.

For more information on AB members, terms, election process and responsibilities, please see the [AB Website](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) and the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/).

## Technical Architecture Group (TAG)
The work of the Technical Architecture Group (TAG) is focused on Web Architecture and technical outputs of W3C. The TAG will discuss and resolve issues on Web Architecture related topics and coordinate cross-technology architecture developments inside and outside W3C.

The TAG is devised of the W3C Director (currently Tim Berners-Lee, who is also a TAG life-member), three director-appointed individuals and six individuals elected by the [AC](). TAG members participate as individuals, not on behalf of their employer. The TAG provides updates on it's activities at AC Meetings and towards the AC on the AC (Annoucement / Discussion?!) Mailing List.

For more information on TAG members, terms, election process and responsibilities, please see the [TAG Website](https://www.w3.org/2002/ab/) and the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#TAG).

# W3C Interest and Working Groups

Interest and Working Groups work to gain consensus on particular topics and issues related to specification development. To understand how consensus works in the W3C please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Consensus). 

## W3C Groups
There are two types of W3C group:

* **Working Groups**: work on deliverables, usually technical reports (standards).
* **Interest Groups**: evaluate potential Web technologies and policies. Do not work on technical reports. 

Groups have: a publicly available Charter, a Chair (or co-Chairs), a Team Contact, and a mailing list.

A group sometimes will have **Task Forces** which carry our assignments which are already detailed in the group Charter. 

For more information on groups see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#ChapterGroups).

## Participants
Participants in Interest and Working Groups should be technically capable, fair and confident to speak and interact with others in the group. AC members nominate people within their organisation to participate within groups (in some cases an AC member may be able to [nominate someone from outside their organisation](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#member-rep)).

For more information on members including dismisal processes see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#ParticipationCriteria).

A Conflict of Interest Policy exists which instructs participants on how to disclose any conflict of interest a participant may have with the W3C and / or group work. See the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#coi) for more information.

## Meetings
Meetings can either be face-to-face or "distributed" (via teleconference, IRC and / or video conferencing). Meeting announcements are sent on Interest or Working Group mailing lists.

Typically meetings are only open to group participants. Sometimes a meeting guest will be invited, this guest will not have voting rights. 

Face-to-face meetings should be announced eight weeks before the meeting, distributed meetings one week before. 

For more information on meetings please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#GeneralMeetings).

## Consensus and Formal Objections
Consensus is a core value of W3C. The W3C agreed definition for Consensus and Dissent is given below; for more information please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Consensus).

1. **Consensus:** A substantial number of individuals in the set support the decision and nobody in the set registers a Formal Objection. Individuals in the set may abstain. Abstention is either an explicit expression of no opinion or silence by an individual in the set. Unanimity is the particular case of consensus where all individuals in the set support the decision (i.e., no individual in the set abstains).
2. **Dissent:** At least one individual in the set registers a Formal Objection.

### Group Decision Appeals and Formal Objections
A set of group members may appeal a group decision. The group should first register their opinion with the chair and team contact, and then rasie a **Group Decision Appeal** which requests the Director to review the decision. For more information please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#WGAppeals).

Individuals may raise a **Formal Objection** against Interest or Working Group decisions. The Director will review any Formal Objections and the related group decision. Formal Objections should contain technical arguments and proposed changes. Formal Objections will be public. 

For more information on Formal Objections please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Consensus).

## Votes
Sometimes, no matter how hard a group tries, consensus cannot be reached for a decision. In these cases, voting is sometimes used. Chairs must follow clear steps and record a set of information when voting, for details on this please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Votes).

Voting may also be used for minority issues; these votes have less stringest rules. For details on this please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#Votes). 


# Communication
The W3C Team will publish information on W3C Technical Reports, the Mission Statement, Legal Documents (such a Membership Agreements), The Process Document and results of W3C Activites and Workshops. Other W3C related news is distributed regularly.

For more information on communication and confidentiality levels please see the [W3C Process Document](https://w3c.github.io/w3process/#chapterDissemination).
