## Further Questions to Answer
These questions and subsequent discussion should help us understand what needs to be completed as part of the Task Force Activities. 

* What keeps a WG from being "effective"?
  * Experience from task force members?
  * could be answered by the [Common Standards Issues](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/CSI.md) document
  * if so, further work could be done to improve this document
  * Is that enough?
* Are issues "common"?
  * or - are WGs too different and experience different issues (therefore defining "common issues" is impossible)
* Where is the current available information on how to participate in a WG, and how to progress a standard though the standard process?
* What needs to different types of attendees have?
* How do chairs impact the WG effectives?
  * What can be done to support chairs?
  * How effective is the current chair training?
* How do team contacts impact the WG effectives?
  * What can be done to support team contacts?
* Would clearer documentation assist the various types of attendee?
  * See below "Proposal for Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees"
* Are meetings necessary?
  * Is there a culture of teleconf schedules, and are they useful?
* Are language and other cultural barriers an issue?
  * what can be done to overcome these?
* How does testing push or delay the standards process within WGs?

  * Are these easy to use?
