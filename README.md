# Working Group Effectiveness Task Force
The Working Group Effectiveness Task Force is a W3C AB organised task force which aims to assess and work on solutions to improve working group effectiveness in W3C working groups. 

The Task Force was setup after the assessment of some working groups which, although producing well used technologies, were not able to complete their chartered specifications on time. In response, the [Common Standards Issues](CSI.md) document was created, which aimed to help working groups identify issues affecting their progress, and help them solve these. The creation of the [Common Standards Issues](CSI.md) document lead to the creation of this Task Force. 

The Task Force is currently identifying [what makes a working group affective](wg_effective.md) and [attendee roles within a working group](wg_attendee_roles.md). Identifying these will allow the Task Force to give advice and create solutions which allow all working group attendees to contribute to successful working groups.

For other goals of the task force, see the below "Expectations" seciton.


## Outcomes
The group has agreed to work on the current outcomes. 

1. [Common Standards Issues](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/CSI.md) Document
1. Ombudsman for Working Group Effectiveness with Guidelines for Escalation
  * W3C currently has team contacts who can be approached with issues related to working group effectivness. This team should be reviewed (possibly adding some non team contacts) and promoted within the W3C
  * The team should have guidelines on what happens when issues need to be escalated. The task force will need to work on a flow. 
1. Updated /guide (Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees)
  * Needs to include targetted information for:
    * chairs
    * participants
    * implementers
  * Re-organised so attendees can find information easily (this is an information architecture exercise)
  * Must include information on how to effectively use tools
  * Updated look and feel - ask team who work on W3C spec design
  * Must include an update schedule
1. Something to enable groups to work on better Testing
1. Dedicated TPAC Sessions
  * Dedicated sessions at TPAC will be both information giving and sharing sessions. Task Force members can inform chairs as to the new available tools and information. Chairs can share information on what has and has not worked for them in their respective groups. 
  * Task Force members should also have some one-to-one discussions with chairs to get some more insight into issues working groups have experiences and how they have dealt with these.

  * [ ] New chairs (how to start a WG, how to run a WG)
