# Chair Emails
This document lists a set of emails which we can send to chairs when they join the W3C as a chair and throughout their time being a chair.

## Welcome Email
**Email to send when a chair joins.**

Hi [name],

Thank-you for agreeing to become a Chair for the [group_name] at W3C! Working Groups require chairs to push work forward, steer the Working Group towards consensus and ensure the group achieves its aims set out in it's Charter. Your role is important both to the participants in the group and for the web as a whole, so thanks once again. This email will give you some information on what to expect, where to get information, and who to turn to for advice. 

You can find several useful resources for chairs at [/Guide](https://www.w3.org/Guide/) and [Current Working Group Resources](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/current_wg_resources.md). 

If you would like an experienced chair buddy to help familiarize you with your new role, please contact @@@. 

You have been added to the chairs@w3.org email list. Feel free to use this list to communicate with other chairs. 

@todo: complete
