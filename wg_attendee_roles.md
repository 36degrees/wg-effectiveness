# Working Group Attendee Roles
Working Groups across standards bodies have a unique mixture of attendees; some of these attendees will work on specifications, some may work for vendors, some may implement, others may observe. Below is a list of roles Working Group attendees may align to; some attendees will fit multiple of these roles, others may fit none. Most attendees should fit in one to two roles.

This list has been created to aid the Working Group Effectiveness Task Force in understanding how to aid Working Group members in completing the specs detailed in their Working Group charter. By understanding the Working Group attendee roles better solutions can be crerated to help these attendees contribute to shipping a successful specification.
