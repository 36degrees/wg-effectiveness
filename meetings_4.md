### Discussed
Question | Discussions | Covered By Output
--- | --- | ---
What keeps a WG from being "effective"? | Has largley been answered within the CSI document, although discussion on the Big Problems is continuing | CSI Document, Updated /guide, Ombudsman, Testing
Are issues "common" | Often yes, although the mix of issues within working groups is different. The CSI document should allow WGs to figure out their mix of issues, and respond to these. | CSI Document
Where is the current available information on how to participate in a WG, and how to progress a standard though the standard process? | Currently in /guide/ and split between multiple wiki pages. This needs work, so attendees can easily find guidelines on participating, chairing, and implementing within working groups | Updated /guide
How do chairs impact the WG effectiveness? | Chairs have a large impact on the effeciveness of the WG. Making sure chairs have a positive impact on effectivenes can come from giving chairs easy to digest information and chairing | Updated /guide, Chair Sessions, Ombudsman, CSI Document
How effective is the current chair training? | Need to assess this at next TPAC with dedicated discussions with chairs | Chair Sessions
How do tools impact the progress of the WG? | Tools can drastically aid the effectiveness of working groups within W3C. However, not all groups understand how to use them. New easy to find and read guides should be published as to how to effectively use tools to aid working group effectiveness | Updated /guide
