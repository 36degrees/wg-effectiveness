This document details all the plans for TPAC for the Working Group Effectiveness Task Force! Please us this resource as a guide to events and to answer questions related to the groups activities.

## TPAC Plans
Below is a list of important TPAC items for the WGE Task Force! Please also see the main [TPAC agenda](https://www.w3.org/2017/11/TPAC/ac-agenda.html). 

**Remember at TPAC the members of the WGE Task Force should be canvasing WG Chairs to find out about their needs for training and their common issues related to effectiveness. Please use the [Chair's Questions](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/chairquestions.md) page for guidance on questions to ask chairs. Please bring your findings to the next WGE Task Force call post-TPAC.**

## Q&A
* **Q:** What is the Working Group Effectiveness Task Force?
  * **A:** A W3C AB organised task force which aims to assess and work on solutions to improve working group effectiveness in W3C working groups.
* **Q:** What is the task force working on?
  * **A:** We have so much to do so we've divided our tasks into two phases. At the moment we're working on producing a documentation to help chairs, editors and attendees both on general W3C process and using Github. We're also working on promoting Testing as core to spec development (with Testing videos and promotion efforts at TPAC) and doing some research with group chairs to find out what types of chair training W3C should work on in the future.
* **Q:** Can I be a member of the task force?
  * **A:** New members are always welcome! I'll send a note to the Natasha and plh to get you setup.
* **Q:** Where can I get more information on the Task Force?
  * **A:** Checkout out our [Github repo](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness).
