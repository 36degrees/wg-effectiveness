* What other questions do you have?

## Proposal for Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees
Documentation on how to participate in W3C WGs is split between multiple wikipages, github repos and emails. This means new members find difficulty in finding information as to how to participate and maybe give up trying. This proposal is a simple extension to one of the W3C sites (w3.org?) where all attendees can discover simple (and easily translated) documentation on how to be an affective W3C attendee.

## Proposal for Ombudsman for WGE
An Ombudsman is an individual or set of individuals who can be approached anonymously to discuss something with which an attendee is concerned about. Standards bodies often have ombudsman for "code of conduct" related reasons. In this case, the Ombudsman will be available to discuss any WGE issues which may be occuring within a WG and with which that individual does not feel comfortable discussing openly. The Ombudsmand then takes action, with full coordination with the individual expressing the concern initially.
