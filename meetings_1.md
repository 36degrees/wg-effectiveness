* Implementer Attendee

## Further Questions to Answer
These questions and subsequent discussion should help us understand what needs to be completed as part of the Task Force Activities. 

* What keeps a WG from being "effective"?
  * Experience from task force members?
  * could be answered by the [Common Standards Issues](https://github.com/w3c/wg-effectiveness/blob/master/CSI.md) document
  * if so, further work could be done to improve this document
  * Is that enough?
* Where is the current available information on how to participate in a WG, and how to progress a standard though the standard process?
* Would clearer documentation assist the various types of attendee?
  * See below "Proposal for Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees"

## Proposal for Easy to Read and Access Information for New and Existing Attendees
Documentation on how to participate in W3C WGs is split between multiple wikipages, github repos and emails. This means new members find difficulty in finding information as to how to participate and maybe give up trying. This proposal is a simple extension to one of the W3C sites (w3.org?) where all attendees can discover simple (and easily translated) documentation on how to be an affective W3C attendee.
